**Timing/venue**: Fri 1400-1600 ICube Auditorium. Lectures start at 1400 sharp and end around 1545 (15 minutes to travel to next lecture).

Each lecture consists of two sections:

* First half: _Flipped classroom_ format. Discusses the learning outcomes of the current week.
* Second half: A preview of the learning outcomes for the following week.

**Attendance**: Attendance for the ==first lecture is compulsory==.

**Webcast**: All lectures will be webcast. However, some things are not captured well in the webcast recording. You are advised to treat the webcast as a 'backup' for you to catch up anything missed during the lecture.

**Handouts**: All learning materials are organized around learning outcomes (not lectures or topics), are given in Web format, and can be found in the [Textbook]({{baseUrl}}/book/index.html) section and are also hyperlinked from the [Schedule Page]({{baseUrl}}/schedule/index.html).  

**Slides**: Our lecture slides are not suited for printing or using as a reference during the lecture/exams. Tey are only an aid for lecture delivery. Slides will be uploaded *after* the lecture.
