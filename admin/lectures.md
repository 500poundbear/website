Â  CS2103T lectures are on Fridays 2-4pm at ICube auditorium, same as that for CS2103.
  Please ignore the CS2101 session scheduled at the same slot. That is a dummy slot used to work around a limitation on the CORS IT system. %%The system doesn't allow lectures of two modules to be scheduled in the same venue at the same time.%%

Each lecture consists of two sections:

* First half: _Flipped classroom_ format. Discusses the learning outcomes of the current week.
* Second half: A preview of the learning outcomes for the following week.

**Attendance**: Attendance for the ==first lecture is compulsory==.

**Webcast**: All lectures will be webcast. However, some things are not captured well in the webcast recording. You are advised to treat the webcast as a 'backup' for you to catch up anything missed during the lecture.

**Handouts**: There are no handouts. All learning materials are organized around learning outcomes (not lectures or topics), are given in Web format, and can be found in the [Textbook]({{baseUrl}}/book/index.html) section and are also hyperlinked from the [Schedule Page]({{baseUrl}}/schedule/index.html).  

**Slides**: Our lecture slides are not suited for printing or using as a reference during the lecture/exams. They are only an aid for lecture delivery. Slides will be uploaded *after* the lecture.
