We use the [TEAMMATES](http://teammatesv4.appspot.com/) online peer evaluation system to conduct several rounds of peer-evaluations.
All peer evaluations will be taken into account when determining your participation marks. The system also allows you to give anonymous feedback to your teammates.

**Extra Requirements:** [considered for participation marks]

* Submitting peer evaluations is compulsory. ==If you routinely miss submitting peer evaluations, you forfeit your participation marks.==
* TEAMMATES normally allows students to access it without using Google login. In this module, we ==require you to login to TEAMMATES using your Google account==.
* After you login to TEAMMATES, please complete your profile. CS2103 is a big class. This profile helps us to remember you better, even after the module is over.
* Please upload a suitable profile photo.

Giving constructive feedback to others is a valuable skill for software engineers. It is also an intended learning outcome of this module. ==Those who give half-hearted feedback will be penalized.==

Here are some things to keep in mind:

*  Assume you are giving feedback to a colleague, not a friend. Keep the tone of your feedback reasonably professional. Do not use offensive language or slang.
*  The feedback should be honest and consistent. Giving positive qualitative feedback (e.g. `Thanks for all the hard work!` and negative ratings (e.g. `Equal share - 40%`) to the same team member is not being honest.
*  State your expectations early. All too often students give positive/neutral feedback early (hoping that the team member will improve later) and trash the team member in the final evaluation (because the he/she did not improve as expected). However, this could be confusing to the recipient. It is better to give negative feedback early so that the team member gets a clear signal that he/she needs to improve.

The final peer evaluation will be used to determine the level of contribution from each member to the project. In that peer-evaluation you will be asked to ==estimate the contribution of each team member== (including yourself) to the project so far.
