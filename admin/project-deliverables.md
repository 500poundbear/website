To expedite your project implementation, you will be given some sample code (AddressBook-Level1 to AddressBook-Level4, shown as `AB-1` to `AB-4` in the diagram above) that you can use as the basis for improving your individual skills during Phases A and as the basis for your project in Phase B.

`AB-4` is the version you will use as the starting point for your final project. Some of the work you do in `AB-1` to `AB-3` can be ported over to `AB-4` and can be used to claim credit in the final project. 

The sub-sections further down explain each project deliverable in detail.
