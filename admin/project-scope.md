**Individually**, each student is expected to,

1. **Contribute one or more enhancements**<br>
  Each enhancement should be stand-alone but should fit with the rest of the software and should have the consent of the team members.
  
   <panel header="Allowed enhancements" expanded>
   
   Here are the allowed options for enhancing AddressBook:
   
   1. [Highly recommended] Rename the product to a more catchy name.
   1. Add more features related to managing contacts. %%e.g. support storing birthdays of contacts%%
   1. Enhance existing features. %%e.g. make the `find` feature more powerful%%
   1. Make the command syntax more user friendly %%e.g. allow more variations of the keywords, change command format to an easier to type syntax%%
   1. Add features that allows managing things other than contacts. %%e.g. todo items, appointments, deadlines, etc.%%
   1. Modify the internal design %%e.g. change the architecture%%
   1. Modify the GUI design %%e.g. remove the browser component and replace with something else%%
   1. Integrate with online services %%e.g. Google contacts, Facebook, GitHub, etc.%%
   1. Incorporate more useful tools/libraries/frameworks into the product or the project workflow %%(e.g. automate more aspects of the project workflow using a GitHub plugin)%%

1. **Contribute to all aspects of the project**: e.g. write backend code, frontend code, test code, user documentation, and developer documentation. If you limit yourself to certain aspects only, you will lose marks allocated for the aspects you did not do.

1. **Contribute incrementally**: A student's contribution should be incremental, over at least three releases of the product. It should not be done in one big burst.

1. Write **~0.5 KLoC of code**, on average.

**As a team**, you are expected to work together to,

1. **Maintain product integrity**: 
   a. Enhancements added fit together to form a cohesive product.
   b. Documentation follow a consistent style and presents a cohesive picture to the reader.
   c. Final project demo presents a cohesive picture to the audience.
1. **Preserve product quality**: i.e. prevent regressions in other parts of the product as the product evolves. Note that bugs local to a specific feature will be counted against the author of that feature. However, if a PR breaks the entire product, the whole team will have to share the penalty.
1. **Manage the project smoothly**: ensure i.e. PR workflow, repo maintenance, integration, releases, etc. are done smoothly.
