<h4 id="v10-documentation">v1.0 Documentation</h4>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To analyze requirements, conceptualize the next version of the product (i.e. v2.0), and document it.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-brainstorm-user-stories">Step 1 : Brainstorm user stories</h4>
<img src="/website/admin/images/v00.png" width="250px">
<p>Get together with your team members and brainstorm user stories <strong>for the v2.0 of the product</strong>. Note that in the project you will deliver only up to v1.5 but here you should consider up to v2.0 (i.e. beyond the module).</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is ok to have more user stories than you can deliver in the project.You should have at least 30 user stories. Include all 'obvious' ones you can think of but also look for 'non obvious' ones that you think are likely to be missed by other teams.</li>
  <li>Write each use story in a piece of paper (e.g. yellow sticky note, index card, or just pieces of paper about the size of a playing card). Alternatively you can use an online tool such as Trello for recording the initial collection of user stories.</li>
  <li>Note that <mark>you should not 'evaluate' the value of user stories while doing the above</mark>. An important aspect of brainstorming is not judging the ideas generated.</li>

<p>Suggested workflow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Take one use story at a time and get team member opinions about it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on the team consensus, put the story (i.e. the piece of paper) onto one of these three piles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>Must-Have</code> : The product will be practically useless without this feature.</li>
      <li><code>Nice-To-Have</code> : The target user can benefit from this user story significantly but you are not certain if you'll have time to implement it.</li>
      <li><code>Not-Useful</code> : No significant benefit to the target use, or does not fit into the product vision.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all stories have been put in the above three piles, you can make a record of which stories are in the three piles.</p>

<h4 id="step-3-record-v20-requirements-in-the-developer-guide">Step 3: Record v2.0 Requirements in the Developer Guide</h4>
<p>Based on your user story categorization in step 1, given project requirements, and the current state of the product, select which user stories you are likely to include in v2.0.</p>
<p>Update the following pages of the Developer Guide:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User Stories</strong>: Give a list of the user stories, including priorities. This can include user stories considered but will not be included in the final product.</li>
  <li><strong>Use cases</strong>: Give use cases (textual form) for a few representative user stories that need multiple steps to complete. <span class="dimmed">e.g. Adding a tag to a person (assume the user needs to find the person first)</span></li>
  <li><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong>:<br> Note: Many of the project constraints mentioned above are NFRs. You can add more. e.g. performance requirements, usability requirements, scalability requirements, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Glossary</strong>: Define terms that are worth defining.</li>
  <li><strong>Product survey</strong> [Optional]: Explore a few similar/related products and describe your findings i.e. Pros, cons, (from the target user's point of view).</li>

</p>
<p><strong>Suggested length</strong>: Follow the existing user guide and developer guides in terms of the level of details.</p>
<p><strong>Submission</strong>: Update the relevant sections of the relevant asciidoc documents in your repo.</p>
<p><strong>Grading</strong>: Reaching this milestone (and future milestones) will be counted under 'Project management' component of the final project grade.<br> To claim this milestone as 'reached', you should at least have a full draft version of the above
  documents in some format (e.g. GoogleDoc), even if you did not have time to update the documents in the repo.</p>
<h3 id="v10-product">v1.0 Product</h3>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To familiarize yourself with the code.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Divide the component among yourselves. Each member can do some small enhancements to the component they are in charge of to learn the code of that component. Some suggested enhancements are given in the AddressBook-Level4
  developer guide.</p>
<p><strong>Submission</strong>: Create PRs from your own fork to your team repo.</p>
<p><strong>Grading</strong>: This is an individual milestone. Considered reached if you have at least attempted to enhance the code of a component, even if you did not fully succeed.</p>
