### v1.5rc Product

`rc` = Release Candidate

Functionality expectations: **Freeze features** after reaching this milestone. As this is a release candidate, it should have all the features you intend to release at v1.5. Adding more features after this point is risky. The remaining time should be left aside for fixing problems discovered late.  
Other suggestions:

* Bring code coverage near to your target if it is low.
* After you have sufficient code coverage, fix remaining code quality problems and bring up the quality to the level you target.

**Submission**: as before.

**Grading**: Your product should show significant progress since the previous milestone.

### v1.5rc Documentation

Update to match the product.

**Submission**: Must be included in the version tagged `v1.5rc`. 

### v1.5rc Demo

As before, but this ==can be an incremental demo== (i.e. explain only what's new since the previous release).
