      <li><strong>Create a GitHub organization</strong> for your team. We'll refer to this organization as <em>team org</em> from now on.</li>
      <li><strong>One member: Fork <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/samplerepo-workflow-practice">se-edu/samplerepo-workflow-practice</a> to your team org</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Each team member: Fork that repo</strong> from your team org to your own GitHub account.</li>
      <li><strong>Each team member: Create a PR</strong> to add a file <code>yourName.md</code><span class="dimmed"> (e.g. <code>jonhDoe.md</code>) </span> containing a brief resume of yourself.</li>
      <li><strong>For each PR: review, update, and merge.</strong> i.e. for each PR</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>A team member (not the PR author): Review the PR by adding comments (can be just dummy comments).</li>
      <li>PR author: Update the PR by pushing more commits to it, to simulate updating the PR based on review comments.</li>
      <li>Another team member: Merge the PR using the GitHub interface.</li>
      <li>All members: Sync fork with upstream changes.</li>

      <li><strong>Create conflicting PRs.</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Each team member: Create a PR to add yourself under the <code>Team Members</code> section in the <code>README.md</code>.</li>
      <li>One member: in the <code>master</code> branch, remove John Doe and Jane Doe from the <code>README.md</code>, commit, and push to the main repo.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="7">
      <li><strong>Merge PRs one at a time.</strong> Before merging a PR, you’ll have to resolve conflicts. Steps:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>[Optional] A member can inform the PR author (by posting a comment) that there is a conflict in the PR.</li>
      <li>PR author: Pull the <code>master</code> branch from the repo in your team org. Merge the pulled <code>master</code> branch to your PR branch. Resolve the merge conflict that crops up during the merge. Push the updated PR branch to your fork.</li>
      <li>Another member or the PR author: When GitHub does not indicate a conflict anymore, you can go ahead and merge the PR.</li>
