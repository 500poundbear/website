No midterm.  
Final exam:

* 2 hours, open book, MCQ and essay type questions, covers Learning Outcomes (LOs) of up to :star::star::star: level.
* ==This semester's exam paper will be very different from previous years==. A sample will be provided near to the exam. You are recommended not to rely on past exam papers.
* Exam consultations (consultations near the exam) are discouraged but allowed. We prefer you to learn and clarify along the way, not at the end.
* Study tips:
  * Go through the worked examples in the module website under each LO.
  * Learn all parts of the project, not just the part you did.
  * Explore how your project can be extended to support more features.  

Note that a large part of CS2103 exam paper measures how well you can apply SE theory to a project. Therefore, the exam is strongly connected to the project and how you Â applied theory in the project. The exam will be easy for you if you attend lectures, participate in tutorials(tutorials too are focused on application of theory to the project), and do a sincere job in the project. ==You will not be able to ace the exams by simply doing past papers just before the exams.==
