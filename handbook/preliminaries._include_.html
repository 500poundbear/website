<p><strong>Where is everything?</strong> CS2103/T-related information are mainly in one of these two places:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong><a href="../schedule/index.html">Schedule page</a></strong> (organized chronologically): That is the one page you need to refer weekly.</li>
  <li><strong>Module handbook</strong> (i.e. this page. organized by topic) This is a reference document supplementary to the schedule page. This page contains a lot of text, probably too much to read in one sitting. Instead, <mark>skim through it quickly to learn what it contains.</mark>    You can come back to read details as-and-when the need arises. The schedule page lists relevant sections of the Handbook you should read at various points.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CS2103 Vs CS2103T</strong>: Same lectures, same exam. Separate tutorials, separate project grading. Unless specified otherwise, whatever is stated for one module applies to the other.</p>
