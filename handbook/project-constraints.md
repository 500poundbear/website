Your project should comply with the following constraints.
%%**Reason**%%: to increase comparability among submissions and to maximize applicability of module content in the project.

* **Constraint-Morph**: The final product should be a result of morphing the given sample code. i.e. enhance and/or evolve the given code to arrive at the new software. However, you are allowed to replace all existing code with new code, as long as it is done incrementally. %%e.g. one feature/component at a time%%<br/>
  %%**Reason:** To ensure your code has a decent quality level from the start.%%

* **Constraint-CLI**: Command Line Interface is the primary mode of input. If you implement a GUI, it should be primarily for output. That is, the GUI is used to give visual feedback rather than to collect input. Some minimal use of mouse is OK (e.g. to click the minimize button), but the primary input should be command-driven. Mouse actions should have keyboard alternatives and typing is preferred over key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse or key combinations.  

* **Constraint-Human-Editable-File**: The data should be stored locally and should be in a human editable text file. Use of relational or No-SQL databases are not allowed.<br/> 
  %%**Reason:** To allow advanced users to manipulate the data by editing the data file.%%

* **Constraint-OO**: The software should follow the Object-oriented paradigm.<br/> 
  %%**Reason:** For you to practice OOP that you learned in the course.%%

* **Constraint-Windows**: The software should work on the Windows platform.<br/>
  %%**Reason:** Final testing will be done on Windows machines.%%

* **Constraint-No-Installer**: The software should work without requiring an installer. Having an optional installer is OK as longs as the portable (non-installed) version has all the critical functionality.  
  %%**Reason:** We do not want to install all your projects on our testing machines when we test them for grading.%%

* **Constraint-External-Software**: The use of third-party frameworks/libraries is allowed but only if they,
    *   are free.
    *   do not require any installation by the user of your software.
    *   do not violate other constraints.

  and is subjected to prior approval by us.<br> 
  %%**Reason:** We will not allow third-party software that can interfere with the learning objectives of the module.%%

  Please post your request for approval in IVLE forum before you start using the library.<br/>
  %%**Reason:** The whole class should know which external software are used by others so that they can do the same if they wish to.%%
