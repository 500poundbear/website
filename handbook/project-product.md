This product is meant for folks who can type fast, spend most of the time near a computer, and prefer typing over mouse/voice commands. Therefore, ==Command Line Interface (CLI) is the primary mode of input.== The GUI is primarily used to give visual feedback rather than to collect input. Some minimal use of mouse is OK (e.g. to click the minimize button), but the primary input should be CLI-driven. Mouse actions should have keyboard alternatives and typing a command is preferred over key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse or key combinations.
