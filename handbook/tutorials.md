==IMPORTANT: Our tutorials start on week 2 (even before CORS tutorial bidding is over), not in week 3 as other modules do. CS2103 (not CS2103T) students need to choose a temporary tutorial slot for week 2 tutorial. We'll inform you the procedure to do so in due course.==

**What happens during the tutorial**:

* A tutorial has two tutors. Each tutor will work with two teams.
* The tutor will direct students to share/discuss evidence of achieving the learning outcomes (LO) allocated to the week. 
* If some students have met with difficulties while achieving an LO, the tutor can direct those students to get help from those who have achieved the LO. ==The number of LOs that can be covered in the tutorial session depends on how well-prepared you are.==
* The tutor will observe, and give feedback on, how well you are achieving required LOs.

**The role of our tutors** is different from tutors in other modules.

* **No direct tech help**: Tutors are prohibited from giving technical help, because we want you to learn the vital survival skill of troubleshooting technical problems.    
  %%[cf Appendix D: How to get tech help]%%
* **No ‘teaching’**: Tutors are prohibited from “teaching” concepts that are covered in lectures or handouts. Self-learning is a vital part of the module. But tutors may help you clarify doubts. For example consider these two questions you might want to ask a tutor:
  * *This is how I understood/applied coupling. Is that correct?* - Such questions are welcome.    
    **Reason**:This question shows you have put in some effort to learn the topic and seeking further clarification from the tutor. 
  * *What is coupling?* - Such questions will not be entertained.    
  **Reason**: This question implies you haven’t done what you could to learn the topic in concern. 
* **No leading from the front**: Tutors are not expected to lead your project effort. They will not tell you how to do project tasks or when to do project tasks. You have to figure those out yourselves. But tutors will give you feedback on how you are doing (or have done) project tasks so that you can improve further.

**Timing/venue:**

* Please refer to the Schedule page for further details on each tutorial.
* You are expected to arrive on time.
  * If your tutorial is in **COM1-B103**: If you arrive early, you may enter the tutorial room by the door near the staircase and wait in the empty area of the room until the current class vacates the room.
  * If your tutorial is in **SR5** or **SR10**: If you arrive early, please wait outside the room until you are asked to come in.
* You may leave the class 15 minutes before the hour if you have another class right after. There is no need to wait till the tutor dismisses you. However, inform the tutor (as a courtesy) before leaving if you leave before the class is dismissed.
* Please make sure you ==vacate the table 5 minutes before the hour== so that the next group can start on time.
* In the past many students have suggested to increase the tutorial duration because 1 hour is barely enough to get through all the tutorial tasks. Increasing the tutorial time is not possible due to lack of venues and tutors. Instead, let's try to make the best of the one hour available by coming well prepared and starting on time.

**Grading:**

Tutorials are not graded. However, your conduct will be reviewed by team members and the tutor which will determine your participation marks.

**Other expectations:**

* **Please bring your laptop to tutorials.** You often need it to show your learning activity results. At other times, we ask you to work on project related things with your team members, which too may require the laptop. %%Cf FAQ: [What if I don't carry a laptop around?]()%%
