This Schedule Page is your main source of information for CS2103/T. You will need to refer to it weekly. **More details for the upcoming weeks (and upcoming sections of the text book) will be added as the weeks progress**, so don't print/save content relate to future weeks.

</tip-box>

<tip-box type="success"> 

We did **a complete rewrite of the website** and the text book this semester, including the [underlying platform](https://markbind.github.io/) that generates the web pages. **We _really_ welcome bug reports, suggestions, and contributions**, to be submitted [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103/website/issues).

</tip-box>

<tip-box type="warning"> 

**If you don't like the _click to see more_ style used by this website**, you can use an _all in one_ version of the text book in the [printable version]({{baseUrl}}/book/common/print.html) page and a similar version of admin info in the [Admin]({{baseUrl}}/admin/index.html) page.

**If you don't like the Web version at all**, a partial solution is to use the pdf version (will be uploaded to IVLE) of the text book used in the previous semesters. Note that the content of that file has not been updated since the previous semester and is slightly behind the Web version.
