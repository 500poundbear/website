**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a _programming paradigm_.** A programming paradigm guides programmers to analyze programming problems, and structure programming solutions, in a specific way. Other examples of programming paradigms are [_Procedural Programming_ paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming), [_Functional Programming_ paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), [_Logic Programming_ paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming) etc.
